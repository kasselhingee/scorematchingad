I've reduced the number of different urls in the help. The URLs in the help seem to fail intermittently (four different ones so far), but the package has enough of them that the failure keeps being picked up. 

Currently `urlchecker::url_check()` tells me that one of the urls in the DESCRIPTION is failing. However I have checked them all today manually and they are all working.

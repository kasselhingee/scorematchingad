# Version 0.0.64

URLs to CppAD and Eigen help pages, data locations and even paper locations are breaking frequently enough for CRAN testing to pick up. So I've removed a few urls in this version.

# Version 0.0.63

No change.

# Version 0.0.62

+ Bug for M1Mac test not floating point but actually because sign eigenvectors of Bingham A matrix are undetermined.

# Version 0.0.61

+ Bug fix to passing `paramvec_start` to `ppi_robust()`
+ More generous limit for equality for a M1Mac equality error
+ Faster examples

# Version 0.0.60
Again, tiny polish of description.

# Version 0.0.59
Small polish of DESCRIPTION and examples in response to CRAN review.

# Version 0.0.58
Small clean up of package version number and spelling in help.
